#Mendacity2
This old game had some interesting top-down-shooter action.

Controls:

W A S D : move
right-click: shoot
mouse: aim
R: reload
P: restart game
1 2 3 4 : switch weapons

There isn't much to do in this game except murder civilians. Unfortunately some of the cooler stuff in this game was lost to time.

Bonus include: Inexorable III, another unfinished TDS from ~10 years ago.
